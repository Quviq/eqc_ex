TODO

 - More macros
     pulse_side_effect, pulse_no_side_effect

 - EQC macros
     Should that be EQC.exs and be distributed as source? It should be fine
     as beam but need documentation.

 - Rename modules
   - EQC.Pulse.*

 - Distribution
   - Put instrumented stuff in pulse_otp-project
   - eqc.ex   in eqc-project
   - pulse.ex in pulse-project
   - Setup release to compile Elixir

 - Documentation

 - What's this __using__ stuff?

 - Instrumented/mocked version of global (Erlang lib)

 - Component macros? Maybe later.
