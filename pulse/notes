TODO

- EQC macros
    Should that be EQC.exs and be distributed as source? It should be fine
    as beam but need documentation.

- Distribution
  - Put instrumented stuff in pulse_otp-project
  - eqc.ex   in eqc-project
  - pulse.ex in pulse-project
  - Setup release to compile Elixir

- Documentation

- What's this __using__ stuff?

- quote bind_quoted: [...] do ... end
  Saves unquoting stuff?

- register_attribute?

- Instrumented/mocked version of global (Erlang lib)

- Component macros? Maybe later.
