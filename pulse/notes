- EQC macros
    Should that be EQC.exs and be distributed as source? It should be fine
    as beam but need documentation.

- Distribution
  - Put instrumented stuff in pulse_otp-project
  - eqc.ex   in eqc-project
  - pulse.ex in pulse-project
  - Setup release to compile Elixir

  - Possibly it might be nicer to set this up as a mix project and distribute
    it separately. Uploading it to whereever Elixir packages lived (hex.pm).

- Instrumented/mocked version of global (Erlang lib)

- Component macros? Maybe later.
