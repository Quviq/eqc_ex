- EQC macros
    Should that be EQC.exs and be distributed as source? It should be fine
    as beam but need documentation.

- Distribution
  - Put instrumented stuff in pulse_otp-project
  - eqc.ex   in eqc-project
  - pulse.ex in pulse-project
  - Setup release to compile Elixir

  rebar_elixir_plugin seems to do a good job.
  In ejabberd rebar.config.script we add
  ({eqc_ex, true}) ->
                    [{eqc_ex, ".*", {git, "~/GitHUb/eqc_ex/"}}];

  in other words a dependency to our git repository

  "make" will now get the repository... but somehow building does not work.
  However, when I do "./rebar compile" twice in ejabberd then I see 
  beam files in deps/eqc_ex/ebin

  The path is correct. It can run quickcheck properties. Need to find out
  why rebar compile is not automatically run. Dependency on plugin?

  - Possibly it might be nicer to set this up as a mix project and distribute
    it separately. Uploading it to whereever Elixir packages lived (hex.pm).

- Instrumented/mocked version of global (Erlang lib)

- Component macros? Maybe later.
